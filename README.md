## API objective

The purpose of this API is to have CRUD operations for managing job opportunities.

## Concepts, libs and tools

In this project, I have used mainly the structural concepts of the NestJS Framework where the entity becomes a module and inside the module, you can create the controller, service and other providers, like the repository.
